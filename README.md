# Dotfiles

This repository is for storing my dotfiles, as well as another excuse to familiarize myself further with git and github.

To keep the dotfiles synced with this repo, I'm using a bare git repo on my local machine with a git alias that specifies my git-dir and work-tree and adding files manually to be tracked by git, which then get committed and pushed as they are changed.
